 Environment and Metadata
##########################

.. _sec:envandmetadata:

Environment variables are values you can set in a session, which can be
used to influence the behavior of programs. It's often considered best
practice to use environment variables to pass settings to a program in a
container, because they are easily set and don't rely on writing and
binding in program-specific configuration files. When building a
container you may need to set fixed or default environment variables.
When running containers you may need to set or override environment
variables.

The :ref:`metadata <sec:metadata>` of a container is information that
describes the container. {Singularity} automatically records important
information such as the definition file used to build a container. Other
details such as the version of {Singularity} used are present as
:ref:`labels <sec:labels>` on a container. You can also specify your own
to be recorded against your container.

**********************
 Environment Overview
**********************

When you run a program in a container with {Singularity}, the
environment variables that the program sees are a combination of:

   -  The environment variables set in the base image (e.g. Docker
      image) used to build the container.

   -  The environment variables set in the ``%environment`` section of
      the definition file used to build the container.

   -  *Most* of the environment variables set on your host, which are
      passed into the container.

   -  Any variables you set specifically for the container at runtime,
      using the ``--env``, ``--env-file`` options, or by setting
      ``SINGULARITYENV_`` variables outside of the container.

   -  The ``PATH`` variable can be manipulated to add entries.

   -  Runtime variables ``SINGULARITY_xxx`` set by {Singularity} to
      provide information about the container.

The environment variables from the base image or definition file used to
build a container always apply, but can be overridden.

You can choose to exclude passing environment variables from the host
into the container with the ``-e`` or ``--cleanenv`` option.

We'll go through each place environment variables can be defined, so
that you can understand how the final environment in a container is
created, and can be manipulated.

If you are interested in variables available when you are *building* a
container, rather than when running a container, see :ref:`build
environment section <build-environment>`.

*******************************
 Environment From a Base Image
*******************************

When you build a container with {Singularity} you might *bootstrap* from
a library or Docker image, or using Linux distribution bootstrap tools
such as ``debootstrap``, ``yum`` etc.

When using ``debootstrap``, ``yum`` etc. you are starting from a fresh
install of a Linux distribution into your container. No specific
environment variables will be set. If you are using a ``library`` or
``Docker`` source then you may inherit environment variables from your
base image.

If I build a singularity container from the image
``docker://python:3.7`` then when I run the container I can see that the
``PYTHON_VERSION`` variable is set in the container:

.. code::

   $ singularity exec python.sif env | grep PYTHON_VERSION
   PYTHON_VERSION=3.7.7

This happens because the ``Dockerfile`` used to build that container has
``ENV PYTHON_VERSION 3.7.7`` set inside it.

You can override the inherited environment with ``SINGULARITYENV_`` vars, or the
``--env / --env-file`` flags (see below), but ``Dockerfile`` ``ENV`` vars will
not be overridden by host environment variables of the same name.

************************************
 Environment From a Definition File
************************************

Environment variables can be included in your container by adding them
to your definition file. Use ``export`` in the ``%environment`` section
of a definition file to set a container environment variable:

.. code:: singularity

   Bootstrap: library
   From: default/alpine

   %environment
       export MYVAR="Hello"

   %runscript
       echo $MYVAR

Now the value of ``MYVAR`` is ``Hello`` when the container is launched.
The ``%runscript`` is set to echo the value.

.. code::

   $ singularity run env.sif
   Hello

.. warning::

   {Singularity} 3.6 uses an embedded shell interpreter to evaluate and
   setup container environments, therefore all commands executed from
   the ``%environment`` section have an execution timeout of **5
   seconds** for {Singularity} 3.6 and a **1 minute** timeout since
   {Singularity} 3.7. While it is possible to source a script from there, it
   is not recommended to use this section to run potentially long
   initialization tasks because this would impact users running the
   image and the execution could abort due to timeout.

Build Time Variables in ``%post``
=================================

In some circumstances the value that needs to be assigned to an
environment variable may only be known after e.g. software
installation, in ``%post``. For situations like this, the
``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` variable is provided. Redirecting text to
this variable will cause it to be written to a file called
``/.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh`` that will be sourced at
runtime.

Variables set in the ``%post`` section through
``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` take precedence over those added via
``%environment``.

***************************
 Environment From the Host
***************************

If you have environment variables set outside of your container, on the
host, then by default they will be available inside the container.
Except that:

   -  An environment variable set on the host will be overridden by a variable
      of the same name that has been set either inside the container image, or
      via ``SINGULARITYENV_`` environment variables, or the ``--env`` and
      ``--env-file`` flags.

   -  The ``PS1`` shell prompt is reset for a container specific prompt.

   -  The ``PATH`` environment variable will be modified to contain
      default values.

   -  The ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` is modified to a default
      ``/.singularity.d/libs``, that will include NVIDIA / ROCm
      libraries if applicable.

To override an environment variable that is already set in the container with
the value from the host, use ``SINGULARITY_ENV`` or the ``--env`` flag. For
example, to force ``MYVAR`` in the container to take the value of ``MYVAR`` on
the host:

.. code::

   $ export SINGULARITYENV_MYVAR="$MYVAR"
   $ singularity run mycontainer.sif

   # or
   $ singularity run --env "MYVAR=$MYVAR"

If you *do not want* the host environment variables to pass into the
container you can use the ``-e`` or ``--cleanenv`` option. This gives a
clean environment inside the container, with a minimal set of
environment variables for correct operation of most software.

.. code::

   $ singularity exec --cleanenv env.sif env
   HOME=/home/dave
   LANG=C
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/.singularity.d/libs
   PATH=/startpath:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
   PROMPT_COMMAND=PS1="Singularity> "; unset PROMPT_COMMAND
   PS1=Singularity>
   PWD=/home/dave/doc-tesrts
   SINGULARITY_COMMAND=exec
   SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=/home/dave/doc-tesrts/env.sif
   SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT=/.singularity.d/env/91-environment.sh
   SINGULARITY_NAME=env.sif
   TERM=xterm-256color

.. warning::

   If you work on a host system that sets a lot of environment
   variables, e.g. because you use software made available through
   environment modules / lmod, you may see strange behavior in your
   container. Check your host environment with ``env`` for variables
   such as ``PYTHONPATH`` that can change the way code runs, and
   consider using ``--cleanenv``.

********************************************
 Environment From the {Singularity} Runtime
********************************************

It can be useful for a program to know when it is running in a
{Singularity} container, and some basic information about the container
environment. {Singularity} will automatically set a number of
environment variables in a container that can be inspected by any
program running in the container.

   -  ``SINGULARITY_COMMAND`` - how the container was started, e.g.
      ``exec`` / ``run`` / ``shell``.

   -  ``SINGULARITY_CONTAINER`` - the full path to the container image.

   -  ``SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` - path inside the container to the
      shell script holding the container image environment settings.

   -  ``SINGULARITY_NAME`` - name of the container image, e.g.
      ``myfile.sif`` or ``docker://ubuntu``.

   -  ``SINGULARITY_BIND`` - a list of bind paths that the user
      requested, via flags or environment variables, when running the
      container.

**********************************
 Overriding Environment Variables
**********************************

You can override variables that have been set in the container image, or
define additional variables, in various ways as appropriate for your
workflow.

``--env`` option
================

The ``--env`` option on the ``run/exec/shell`` commands allows you to
specify environment variables as ``NAME=VALUE`` pairs:

.. code::

   $ singularity run env.sif
   Hello

   $ singularity run --env MYVAR=Goodbye env.sif
   Goodbye

Separate multiple variables with commas, e.g. ``--env
MYVAR=A,MYVAR2=B``, and use shell quoting / shell escape if your
variables include special characters.

``--env-file`` option
=====================

The ``--env-file`` option lets you provide a file that contains
environment variables as ``NAME=VALUE`` pairs, e.g.:

.. code::

   $ cat myenvs
   MYVAR="Hello from a file"

   $ singularity run --env-file myenvs env.sif
   Hello from a file

``SINGULARITYENV_`` prefix
==========================

If you export an environment variable on your host called
``SINGULARITYENV_xxx`` *before* you run a container, then it will set
the environment variable ``xxx`` inside the container:

.. code::

   $ singularity run env.sif
   Hello

   $ export SINGULARITYENV_MYVAR="Overridden"
   $ singularity run env.sif
   Overridden

Manipulating ``PATH``
=====================

``PATH`` is a special environment variable that tells a system where to
look for programs that can be run. ``PATH`` contains multiple filesystem
locations (paths) separated by colons. When you ask to run a program
``myprog``, the system looks through these locations one by one, until
it finds ``myprog``.

To ensure containers work correctly, when a host ``PATH`` might contain
a lot of host-specific locations that are not present in the container,
{Singularity} will ensure ``PATH`` in the container is set to a default.

.. code::

   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

This covers the standard locations for software installed using a system
package manager in most Linux distributions. If you have software
installed elsewhere in the container, then you can override this by
setting ``PATH`` in the container definition ``%environment`` block.

If your container depends on things that are bind mounted into it, or
you have another need to modify the ``PATH`` variable when starting a
container, you can do so with ``SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH`` or
``SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH``.

If you set a variable on your host called ``SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH``
then its value will be appended (added to the end) of the ``PATH``
variable in the container.

.. code::

   $ singularity exec env.sif sh -c 'echo $PATH'
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

   $ export SINGULARITYENV_APPEND_PATH="/endpath"
   $ singularity exec env.sif sh -c 'echo $PATH'
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/endpath

Alternatively you could use the ``--env`` option to set a
``APPEND_PATH`` variable, e.g. ``--env APPEND_PATH=/endpath``.

If you set a variable on your host called
``SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH`` then its value will be prepended (added
to the start) of the ``PATH`` variable in the container.

.. code::

   $ singularity exec env.sif sh -c 'echo $PATH'
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

   $ export SINGULARITYENV_PREPEND_PATH="/startpath"
   $ singularity exec env.sif sh -c 'echo $PATH'
   /startpath:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

Alternatively you could use the ``--env`` option to set a
``PREPEND_PATH`` variable, e.g. ``--env PREPEND_PATH=/startpath``.

.. _escaping-environment:

************************************************
Escaping and Evaluation of Environment Variables
************************************************

{Singularity} uses an embedded shell interpreter to process the container
startup scripts and environment. When this processing is performed, by default a
single step of shell evaluation happens in the container context. The shell from
which you are running {Singularity} may also evaluate variables on your command
line before passing them to {Singularity}.

Docker / OCI Compatibility
==========================

This default behavior of {Singularity} differs from Docker/OCI handling of
environment variables / ``ENV`` directives. To avoid the extra evaluation of
variables that {Singularity} performs you can:

* Follow the instructions about escaping in the sections below, to add
  additional escape characters and/or quoting.
* Use the ``--no-eval`` or ``--compat`` flags.


``--no-eval`` prevents {Singularity} from evaluating environment variables on
container startup, so that they will take the same value as with a Docker/OCI
runtime:

.. code::

   # Set an environment variable that would run `date` if evaluated
   $ export SINGULARITYENV_MYVAR='$(date)'

   # Default behavior
   # MYVAR was evaluated in the container, and is set to the output of `date`
   $ singularity run ~/ubuntu_latest.sif env | grep MYVAR
   MYVAR=Tue Apr 26 14:37:07 CDT 2022

   # --no-eval / --compat behavior
   # MYVAR was not evaluated and is a literal `$(date)`
   $ singularity run --no-eval ~/ubuntu_latest.sif env | grep MYVAR
   MYVAR=$(date)


The ``--compat`` flag is a short-hand flag to activate ``--no-eval`` along with
other Docker/OCI compatibility flags. See :ref:`compat-flag` for more details.

Using Host Variables
====================

To set a container environment variable to the value of a variable on
the host, use double quotes around the variable, so that it is
processed by the host shell before the value is passed to
{Singularity}. For example:

.. code::

   singularity run --env "MYHOST=$HOSTNAME" mycontainer.sif

This will set the ``MYHOST`` environment variable inside the container
to the value of the ``HOSTNAME`` on the host system. ``$HOSTNAME`` is
substituted before the host shell runs ``singularity``.

.. note::

   You can often use no quotes, but it is good practice to use quotes
   consistently so that variables containing e.g. spaces are handled
   correctly.

Using Container Variables
=========================

To set an environment variable to a value that references another
variable inside the container, you should escape the ``$`` sign to
``\$``. This prevents the host shell from substituting the
value. Instead it will be substituted inside the container.

For example, to create an environment variable ``MYPATH``, with the
same value as ``PATH`` in the container (not the host's ``PATH``):

.. code::

   singularity run --env "MYPATH=\$PATH" mycontainer.sif

You can also use this approach to append or prepend to variables that
are already set in the container. For example, ``--env
PATH="\$PATH:/endpath"`` would have the same effect as ``--env
APPEND_PATH="/endpath"``, which uses the special ``APPEND/PREPEND``
handling for ``PATH`` discussed above.

Quoting / Avoiding Evaluation
=============================

If you need to pass an environment variable into the container
verbatim, it must be quoted and escaped appropriately. For example, if
you need to set a path containing a literal ``$LIB`` for the
``LD_PRELOAD`` environment variable:

.. code::

   singularity run --env="LD_PRELOAD=/foo/bar/\\\$LIB/baz.so" mycontainer.sif

This will result in ``LD_PRELOAD`` having the value
``/foo/bar/$LIB/baz.so`` inside the container.

The host shell consumes the double ``\\``, and then environment
processing within {Singularity} will consume the third ``\`` that
escapes the literal ``$``.

You can also use single quotes on the command line, to avoid one
level of escaping:

.. code::

   singularity run --env='LD_PRELOAD=/foo/bar/\$LIB/baz.so' mycontainer.sif

*******************************
Environment Variable Precedence
*******************************

When a container is run with {Singularity}, the container
environment is constructed in the following order:

   -  Clear the environment, keeping just ``HOME`` and
      ``SINGULARITY_APPNAME``.
   -  Set Docker/OCI defined environment variables, where a Docker or
      OCI image was used as the base for the container build.
   -  If ``PATH`` is not defined set the {Singularity} default ``PATH``
      *or*
   -  If ``PATH`` is defined, add any missing path parts from
      {Singularity} defaults
   -  Set environment variables defined explicitly in the
      ``%environment`` section of the definition file. These can
      override any previously set values.
   -  Set environment variables that were defined in the ``%post``
      section of the build, by addition to the
      ``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` file.
   -  Set SCIF (``--app``) environment variables
   -  Set base environment essential vars (``PS1`` and
      ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``)
   -  Inject ``SINGULARITYENV_`` / ``--env`` / ``--env-file`` variables
      so they can override or modify any previous values.
   -  Apply special ``APPEND_PATH`` / ``PREPEND_PATH`` handling.
   -  Restore environment variables from the host, if they have not
      already been set in the container, and the ``--cleanenv`` /
      ``--containall`` options were not specified.

.. warning::

   While {Singularity} will process additional scripts found under
   ``/.singularity.d/env`` inside the container, it is strongly
   recommended to avoid manipulating the container environment by
   directly adding or modifying scripts in this directory. Please use
   the ``%environment`` section of the definition file, and the
   ``$SINGULARITY_ENVIRONMENT`` file from ``%post`` if required.

   A future version of {Singularity} may move container scripts,
   environment, and metadata outside of the container's root
   filesystem. This will permit further reproducibility and
   compatibility improvements, but will preclude environment
   manipulation via arbitrary scripts.


.. _sec:umask:

**********************************
 Umask / Default File Permissions
**********************************

The ``umask`` value on a Linux system controls the default permissions
for newly created files. It is not an environment variable, but
influences the behavior of programs in the container when they create
new files.

.. note::

   A detailed description of what the ``umask`` is, and how it works can
   be found at `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask>`__.

{Singularity} 3.7 and above set the ``umask`` in the container to match
the value outside, unless:

   -  The ``--fakeroot`` option is used, in which case a ``0022`` umask
      is set so that ``root`` owned newly created files have expected
      'system default' permissions, and can be accessed by other
      non-root users who may use the same container later.

   -  The ``--no-umask`` option is used, in which case a ``0022`` umask
      is set.

.. note::

   In {Singularity} 3.6 and below a default ``0022`` umask was always
   applied.

.. _sec:metadata:

********************
 Container Metadata
********************

Each {Singularity} container has metadata describing the container, how
it was built, etc. This metadata includes the definition file used to
build the container and labels, which are specific pieces of information
set automatically or explicitly when the container is built.

For containers that are generated with {Singularity} version 3.0 and
later, default labels are represented using the `rc1 Label Schema
<http://label-schema.org/rc1/>`_.

.. _sec:labels:

Inherited Labels
================

When building a container from an existing image, either directly from a
URI or with a definition file, your container will inherit the labels
that are set in that base image. For example the ``LABEL`` a Docker
container sets in its ``Dockerfile``, or a SIF container that sets
labels in its definition file as described below.

Inherited labels can only be overwritten during a build when the build
is performed using the ``--force`` option. {Singularity} will warn that
it is not modifying an existing label when ``--force`` is not used:

.. code::

   $ singularity build test2.sif test2.def
   ...
   INFO:    Adding labels
   WARNING: Label: OWNER already exists and force option is false, not overwriting

.. note::

   {Singularity} 3.0 through 3.8 did not inherit labels from Docker/OCI
   images during a build. {Singularity} 3.9 restores the behavior of
   2.x, and inherits these labels.

Custom Labels
=============

You can add custom labels to your container using the ``%labels``
section in a definition file:

.. code:: singularity

   Bootstrap: library
   From: ubuntu:latest

   %labels
     OWNER Joana

Dynamic Build Time Labels
=========================

You may wish to set a label to a value that is not known in advance,
when you are writing the definition file, but can be obtained in the
``%post`` section of your definition file while the container is
building.

{Singularity} 3.7 and above allow this, through adding labels to the
file defined by the ``SINGULARITY_LABELS`` environment variable in the
``%post`` section:

.. code:: singularity

   Bootstrap: library
   From: ubuntu:latest

   # These labels take a fixed value in the definition
   %labels
     OWNER Joana

   # We can now also set labels to a value at build time
   %post
     VAL="$(myprog --version)"
     echo "my.label $VAL" >> "$SINGULARITY_LABELS"

Labels must be added to the file one per line, in a ``NAME VALUE``
format, where the name and value are separated by a space.

Inspecting Metadata
===================

.. _inspect-command:

The ``inspect`` command gives you the ability to view the labels and/or
other metadata that were added to your container when it was built.

``-l``/ ``--labels``
--------------------

Running inspect without any options, or with the ``-l`` or ``--labels``
options will display any labels set on the container

.. code:: console

   $ singularity inspect ubuntu.sif
   my.label: version 1.2.3
   OWNER: Joana
   org.label-schema.build-arch: amd64
   org.label-schema.build-date: Thursday_12_November_2020_10:51:59_CST
   org.label-schema.schema-version: 1.0
   org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.bootstrap: library
   org.label-schema.usage.singularity.deffile.from: ubuntu:latest
   org.label-schema.usage.singularity.version: 3.7.0-rc.1

We can easily see when the container was built, the source of the base
image, and the exact version of {Singularity} that was used to build it.

The custom label ``OWNER`` that we set in our definition file is also
visible.

``-d`` / ``--deffile``
----------------------

The ``-d`` or ``-deffile`` flag shows the definition file(s) that were
used to build the container.

.. code::

   $ singularity inspect --deffile jupyter.sif

And the output would look like:

.. code:: singularity

   Bootstrap: library
   From: debian:9

   %help

       #List installed environments
       conda list

Which is the definition file for the ``jupyter.sif`` container.

``-r`` / ``--runscript``
------------------------

The ``-r`` or ``--runscript`` option shows the runscript for the image.

.. code::

   $ singularity inspect --runscript jupyter.sif

And the output would look like:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/sh
   OCI_ENTRYPOINT=""
   OCI_CMD="bash"
   # ENTRYPOINT only - run entrypoint plus args
   if [ -z "$OCI_CMD" ] && [ -n "$OCI_ENTRYPOINT" ]; then
   SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN="${OCI_ENTRYPOINT} $@"
   fi

   # CMD only - run CMD or override with args
   if [ -n "$OCI_CMD" ] && [ -z "$OCI_ENTRYPOINT" ]; then
   if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
       SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN="$@"
   else
       SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN="${OCI_CMD}"
   fi
   fi

   # ENTRYPOINT and CMD - run ENTRYPOINT with CMD as default args
   # override with user provided args
   if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
       SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN="${OCI_ENTRYPOINT} $@"
   else
       SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN="${OCI_ENTRYPOINT} ${OCI_CMD}"
   fi

   exec $SINGULARITY_OCI_RUN

``-t`` / ``--test``
-------------------

The ``-t`` or ``--test`` flag shows the test script for the image.

.. code::

   $ singularity inspect --test jupyter.sif

This will output the corresponding ``%test`` section from the definition
file.

``-e`` / ``--environment``
--------------------------

The ``-e`` or ``--environment`` flag shows the environment variables
that are defined in the container image. These may be set from one or
more environment files, depending on how the container was built.

.. code::

   $ singularity inspect --environment jupyter.sif

And the output would look like:

.. code:: bash

   ==90-environment.sh==
   #!/bin/sh

   JUP_PORT=8888
   JUP_IPNAME=localhost
   export JUP_PORT JUP_IPNAME

``-H`` / ``--helpfile``
-----------------------

The ``-H`` or ``-helpfile`` flag will show the container's description
in the ``%help`` section of its definition file.

You can call it this way:

.. code::

   $ singularity inspect --helpfile jupyter.sif

And the output would look like:

.. code::

   Container with Anaconda 2 (Conda 4.5.11 Canary) and Jupyter Notebook 5.6.0 for Debian 9.x (Stretch).
   This installation is based on Python 2.7.15

``-j`` / ``--json``
-------------------

This flag gives you the possibility to output your labels in a JSON
format.

You can call it this way:

.. code:: console

   $ singularity inspect --json ubuntu.sif

And the output would look like:

.. code:: json

   {
           "data": {
                   "attributes": {
                           "labels": {
                                   "my.label": "version 1.2.3",
                                   "OWNER": "Joana",

                           }

***************************
 /.singularity.d directory
***************************

The ``/.singularity.d`` directory in a container contains scripts and
environment files that are used when a container is executed.

*You should not manually modify* files under ``/.singularity.d``, from
your definition file during builds, or directly within your container
image. Recent 3.x versions of {Singularity} replace older action scripts
dynamically, at runtime, to support new features. In the longer term,
metadata will be moved outside of the container, and stored only in the
SIF file metadata descriptor.

-  **actions**: This directory contains helper scripts to allow the
   container to carry out the action commands. (e.g. ``exec`` , ``run``
   or ``shell``). In later versions of {Singularity}, these files may be
   dynamically written at runtime, *and should not be modified* in the
   container.

-  **env**: All ``*.sh`` files in this directory are sourced in alphanumeric
   order when the container is started. For legacy purposes there is a symbolic
   link called ``/environment`` that points to
   ``/.singularity.d/env/90-environment.sh``. Whenever possible, avoid modifying
   or creating environment files manually to prevent potential issues building &
   running containers with future versions of {Singularity}. Additional
   facilities such as ``--env`` and ``--env-file`` are available to allow
   manipulation of the container environment at runtime.

-  **labels.json**: The json file that stores a containers labels
   described above.

-  **libs**: At runtime the user may request some host-system libraries
   to be mapped into the container (with the ``--nv`` option for
   example). If so, this is their destination.

-  **runscript**: The commands in this file will be executed when the
   container is invoked with the ``run`` command or called as an
   executable. For legacy purposes there is a symbolic link called
   ``/singularity`` that points to this file.

-  **runscript.help**: Contains the description that was added in the
   ``%help`` section.

-  **{Singularity}**: This is the definition file that was used to
   generate the container. If more than 1 definition file was used to
   generate the container additional {Singularity} files will appear in
   numeric order in a sub-directory called ``bootstrap_history``.

-  **startscript**: The commands in this file will be executed when the
   container is invoked with the ``instance start`` command.
